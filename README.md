# STAGE-D

The architecture of the brain inspired the neural networks used to build intelligent machines.

In this course, we will explore the building blocks of neural networks, which are versatile, powerful, and scalable. We will learn how to use them to tackle complex problems like the use of convolutional neural networks for image recognition.
